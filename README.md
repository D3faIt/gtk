## About Catppuccin proyect

<p align="center">
	Catppuccin is a community-driven pastel theme that aims to be the middle ground between low and high contrast themes. It provides a warm palette with 18 eye-candy colors that are not only perfect for coding under various light conditions, but also for developing graphical user interfaces, making it extensible for numerous use-cases. In addition, this repository tracks the development of the actual color palette, organization-wide assets, resources and code samples for maintainers/developers.

## ðŸ§  Design Philosophy

-   **Colorful is better than colorless**: the colorfulness of something contributes to the distinction amongst the parts of that _something_, making it marginally easier to understand how things are structured.
-   **There should be balance**: not too dull, not too bright. Suitability under various light conditions is a most.
-   **Harmony is superior to dissonance**: vivacious colors must complement each other.
